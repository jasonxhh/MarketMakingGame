# MarketMakingGame

A market making game to practice for interviews.

Basic version is untimed, Advanced version is timed with stochastic bid and ask prices.

1. Enter the minimum and then maximum of a range of numbers.
      - For example 1 and then 13, to represent 1-13 from a deck of cards
2. Enter another number that is less than the range of the numbers you previous gave
      - Numbers will be drawn from the range of numbers without replacement
      - The point of the game is to "make markets" on the sum of a hidden numbers

The game is to practice taking on positions in the market at the bid/ask profitably given market mispricing of the information available at that point in time.
